Title: Update Invoice Sanity to Report invoices with no call details
Description: The issue of no ccall data being displayed on the invoice was caused by an issue in the

Title: Update Margin in Links for Local & Resale Services
Description: Links Engine has the following line in models/service.rb:

ResaleFactor = 0.8296

When the times comes when we changed the price of Resale
Lines (the Jun Invoice), it looks like the software in
StartStop Services was well written so that we just have
to get a new markup value and change this value.
Ie if the new market value was changed to 25 percent,
we would change this value to 0.7500
